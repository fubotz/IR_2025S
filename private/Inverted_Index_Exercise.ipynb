    "## Data\n",
    "For the sake of the exercise, you can choose between two corpus:\n",
    "* The fairy tales corpus: a collection of ~250 fairy tales from the Gutenberg project. The corpus is available in the file `fairytales.csv.zip`, and contains the following columns:\n",
    "    * `title`: the title of the fairy tale\n",
    "    * `content`: the content of the fairy tale\n",
    "    While the csv is zipped, you don't have to unzip it, you can read it directly using pandas' `read_csv` method with the `compression` parameter set to `zip`, like so:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    df = pd.read_csv('fairytales.csv.zip', compression='zip')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* Or the heavier corpus: `stories.zip`, which contains a collection of 230 books, each divided into chapters as a separate text file. To use the corpus, you don't need to unzip it, you can read the files directly from the zip file, using the python's zipfile module. Here's an example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from zipfile import ZipFile\n",
    "\n",
    "    with ZipFile('stories.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:\n",
    "        # looping over the folders using the `namelist` method:\n",
    "        for file in zip_ref.namelist():\n",
    "            with zip_ref.open(file) as f:\n",
    "                text = f.read().decode('utf-8')\n",
    "\n",
    "                # some naive tokenization - spliting the text by space. You can do better than this ;)\n",
    "                tokens = text.split()\n",
